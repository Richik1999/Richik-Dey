#Tuples in Python

tuple_1=(1,2,3)
#So, a tuple is just a list, instead of that bracket we use parenthesis here..

print(tuple_1)
#you can use index also in tuples like we did in lists.
print(tuple_1[1])

#the real difference in tuples is, you can't add, remove or change anything in list. it is just what it is.
#Tuple is a stable and structured data type. We use it for stable ones, the ones we are not gonna change.

for name, age, favfood in persons:
    print(name)
    print(age)
