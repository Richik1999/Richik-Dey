#As you can see you can also use brackets, and by using them they give result the letter that starts with I, if there is a single I then they will give result as I, even if I is in some words, it will match I give result as that...

#using range..

text_3="Hey Jude, take a sad song and make it better"
pattern_3=re.compile("[a-z]")

#using multiple ranges..

#Using a plus with ranges....

#As you can see, when I use a plus sign (+) it actually adds up entire word.

#using an email address..

#As you can see, now it is giving us our email adress..

#Now, what if we need to find multiple email adress, you have already seen that search function only give result for the first ones.
#So, if we want multiple email adress or multiple things, we need to use the "findall" function..

text_7="My email adress is richikdey1999@gmail.com and my father's email adress is amaldey1960@gmail.com "
pattern_7=re.compile("[a-zA-Z0-9]+@+[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.+[a-zA-Z0-9]+")
result_7=pattern_7.findall(text_7)
print(result_7)

#Now, it is resulting as a clean list of emails.. now, like this... we can do hundreds of hundreds....

#Now, people use special symbols like @, -,_, . , etc... for those you need to escape which means you need to use a backslash(/) before them.

text_8="My email adress is richik_dey.1999@gmail.com"
pattern_8=re.compile("[a-z\_]+\.+[0-9]+@+[a-z]+\.+[a-z]+")

#You have to escape special charecters like this....
