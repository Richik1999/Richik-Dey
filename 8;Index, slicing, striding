#Index, slicing,striding

digits=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

print(digits[0])
print(digits[1])
print(digits[9])

#You can also use negative index..
#It will give you results from the last one..

print(digits[-1])
print(digits[-2])
print(digits[-5])

#ranging in index/Slicing

print(digits[2:5])
#As you can see, the first index is inclusive but the last index is not.
#Now, if you want to print things from very start you don't need to put 0, you do like this...

print(digits[:5])

#As you can see it is printing from the very start upto the 4 index..

s="Hello World"

print(s[:4])

#Also you can do this..

print(digits[5:])
#Now,it will start from 5, because it is inclusive and upto very end digit..

#Striding

print(digits[0:10:1])
#As you can see it is giving us the same result ..

print(digits[0:10:2])
#it is printing the every other number.. it is jumping every one numberss.

print(digits[0:10:3])
#It is printing after every two numberss.. it is jumping every two numberss..

print(digits[::-1])
#it is just reversing the whole list..

print(digits[::-2])
#It is reversing and also jumping one numbers..

print(digits[::-3])
#It is reversing and also jumping two numbers..

#I really didn't understand striding.. I have to understand it well..


print(digits[5:0:-2])
#Maybe because the index is in negative it is in backward that why I put first the 5 and then 0, which means starting from index 5 upto the 0 but 0 is exclusive so, upto 1.

#using for loops in here..

for i in range(len(digits)):
    print(digits[:i])

#an advanced example..

for i in range(len(digits)):
    print(digits[i:i+3])

#Now, here we are printing from i=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] upto (i+3) but it it exclusive, we really printing upto (i+2)

#Or you do like this...

window_size=3
for i in range(len(digits)):
    print(digits[i:i+window_size])

#We can also do this..

window_size=3
for i in range(len(digits)-2):
    print(digits[i:i+window_size])

window_size=5
for i in range(len(digits)-4):
    print(digits[i:i+window_size])

#As you can see, we have to put 1 less than window_size in len to get a whole window size..So, we can do this.

window_size=3
for i in range(len(digits)-(window_size-1)):
    print(digits[i:i+window_size])
#As you can see, now we can put anything at window_size and we don't need to think otherss... so we need to find the relations in between to really precise things or simplify things..
