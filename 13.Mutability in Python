#Mutability with Python

#mutability=changeable
#Imutability=unchangeable

#Lists are mutable which means we can change things in lists.we can add or change or delete things in lists.

#Tuples are immutable which means we can't change anything in tuples, we can't add or change or delete things in tuples.

#Mutables= lists,dictionaries, ordered dictionaries,

#Immutables=tuples, ints, floats, booleans etc.

#Mutables for Flexible Data.
#Immutables for Secure Data.

tuple=(1,2,3,[4,5,6])
#As you can see there is a tuple, in that tuple, we put a list, now, tuples are immutable, but lists are mutable, so they can change.

tuple[3][0]=9
print(tuple)

#As you can see, we changed one item in the list, although we can't change the tuple.
