#Join and Split function

#Using split function
problems="broke, pale, short, nerdy"
print(problems)

l=problems.split(", ")
print(l)

l=problems.split("pale")
print(l)

#Using join function

joined="fucked".join(l)
print(joined)

csv=",".join(l)
print(csv)

#I really need to understand both split and joing function!! and also striding and slicing from the previous..
