#Sets in Python

#You cannot have duplicate in a set.
#Sets are unordered, so you can't iterate through it.

set_1={"Banana","Mango","Blueberry"}
print(set_1)

set_1.add("Strawberry")
print(set_1)

#Now, if we add some same element, it will not add that to the set ..

set_1.add("Mango")

print(set_1)

#As you can see it didn't add.

#another example..

l=[1,0,0,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9]
no_duplicate_set=set(l)

print(no_duplicate_set)
#As you can see that sets can't stand duplicates.

no_duplicate_list=list(no_duplicate_set)

print(no_duplicate_list)

#Using union, intersection, difference

books_1={"Harry Potter", "Game of Thrones","Hunger Games"}
books_2={"Harry Potter","Anne of Green Gables", "Game of Thrones"}

books=books_1.union(books_2)
print(books)

duplicate_books=books_1.intersection(books_2)
print(duplicate_books)
#As you can see it will spit out the duplicate ones..

diff_1=books_1.difference(books_2)
print(diff_1)

diff_2=books_2.difference(books_1)
print(diff_2)

#As you can see difference means minus here.
