#casting in python
#All these casting means it will convert one data types into another data types

#convering integers into floats

q=6
print(float(q))

#or
print(float(6))
print(float(87))

#strings to integer

print(int("Love You 3000"))
#As, you can see it is an error, because you can't convert words into integer...instead .....

print(int("3000"))

#integer to Boolean

print(bool(0))
# In Boolean, only 0 is False and other than that everything is True , like this..

print(bool(8))
print(bool(-9.08))

#Converting into strings

print(str(3300))
#the last one is also so important.
